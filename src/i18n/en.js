        You landed on the site, which is the first prototype of the platform for urban networking We.city. 
        It can help you to find the others, who share your concerns regarding your city/environment,
        and organize your communication with them to find solutions, resources and contractors to resolve it collectively. 
        It is for those who would like to see positive changes around, but do not have time, energy or expertise, to realize them on alone.
